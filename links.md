# Some Helpful Links

1. [OS222 Course Main Link](https://os.vlsm.org/)<br>
Definitely the most useful link for those who enroll this course. It provides all you need. Just gotta read it ðŸ˜«

2. [Vi Basic Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
Basic commands for vi. Can be used for file-related tasks. I'd rather just see those commands through here than memorizing all of them.
