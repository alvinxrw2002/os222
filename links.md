**W01**
1. [OS222 Course Main Link](https://os.vlsm.org/)<br>
Definitely the most useful link for those who enroll this course. It provides all you need. Just gotta read it ðŸ˜«

2. [Vi Basic Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
Basic commands for vi. Can be used for file-related tasks. I'd rather just see those commands through here than memorizing all of them.

<br>

**W02**<br>

3. [Digital/Online Privacy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-online-privacy-7149b33c4a3e/)<br>
Online privacy matters less now. When you share your personal data throughout companies, thereâ€™s no guarantee that theyâ€™ll keep them safe.

4. [Cyber Security Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcDO8km6R6c)<br>
An intro to cyber security. What is it? How to apply it? What could possibly threatens it?

5. [Secure Hashing Algorithm](https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/)<br>
One of the cyber security concept, Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA in the W02 assignment). Basically it encrypts our text with a hash function.

<br>

**W03**<br>

6. [Fuse in linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)<br>
Explains what fues is and what are the commands. This site also explains the kernel side. Can be a good start for understanding fuse.

7. [Linux FHS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-file-hierarchy-structure/)<br>
FHS stands for File Hierarchy Structure. It tells you where and how files are being stored in directories. Each directory has it's own purposes and all of them appear under the root directory.

8. [FHS (short version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)<br>
FHS on 100 seconds. Short yet understandable. It can provide you the basic knowledge. Suitable for those of you who don't have much time or not really enjoy reading.

<br>

**W04**<br>

9. [Memory Management with Address Binding](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-address-binding)<br>
One of the memory management implementations, conducted by the OS and the app that requires access to memory. It allocates a physical memory location to a logical pointer. This can be done by associating a physical address to a logical address, also known as virtual address.

10. [Linux Memory Mapping](https://frameboxxindore.com/linux/what-is-memory-mapping-in-linux.html)<br>
Memory mapping is a mapping mechanism of some files on a storage disk to a range of addresses within an application's address space. The application can then access files on disk in the same way it accesses dynamic memory. In linux, it maps the disk sectors of a file into the virtual memory space of a process.

11. [Another Memory Managements Concepts - Contiguous, Swapping, and Fragmentation](https://www.guru99.com/os-memory-management.html)<br>
More concepts on how OS manages memory. Store data on memory in a contigous way, swapping from the main memory and backing store, and also free memory spaces that are too small to be allocated by any processes.
